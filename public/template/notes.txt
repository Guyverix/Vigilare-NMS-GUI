This directory is an example of how to add addtional pages for use in the NMS.

You must recreate this directory structure with your directory name which will be used for the pathing..

Note that if you make deep directory structures, the include files may be incorrect and require path adjustments.

It is assumed that the path will start under the /public directory

All templating assumes this.  If you do something else, you will likely need to adjust the includes, or the index file

While I call this a template system, it is VERY simplistic.  If there are customizations done it would be a lot less user friendly and make trouble later down the road.

Overall, keeping this "template" simple means it will be possible for even non-developers to extend the UI for what is needed.

Since this is very generic, and even composer is not being used, changes should always be kept at the Tinker-Toy level whenever possible.

YOU liely will not always be the person changing code, and if you make it too comlex, or get "clever" it will be a PITA for someone else to maintain.

Everything I am doing in here is attempting to follow a KISS principle.  I encourage you to attempt this as well.
