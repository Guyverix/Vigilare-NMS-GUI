This is the basic login area.
It also ends up being the catchall for dealing with register and password resets as well.

Remember just because an account was created, does NOT mean that they will be able to access stuff..


the account must be enabled by an admin.  A real human has to say "yes, they are allowed to see stuff"


css is doing strange things when using a symlink to test different login pages.  Current login page is the login_animated.php as a real file not symlink.
