This is going to likely be used more by managers looking at overall health.

This will define the groups and display states of the groups in more
of a red-light green-light way of display.

This will allow for managers to make adhoc groups as well based on device ids.

There MIGHT be an alternate style based on something else, but device is the basic unit of measure for "things" currently.
