This is a universal catchall that is used to get a link fashoned to pull up a ticket for events..

This will be the area that ties tickets to events.

Currently and likely going forward, there will not be ticket auto-creation with this system unless it is requested.

create, update, close will end up being the main options from here going to whatever ticketing system is in use.

Hopefully, it is something that contains either bearer tokens or something simple like basic auth to do all the authentication..

Jira is nasty for that sort of stuff.  

If I do support Jira in the future, I will likely make it as a template so users can define what is "manditory" for tickets, etc.

Likely it will be templates with no logic on the NMS side, but we shall see..  Might need some depending..

Inital plan will be something like RT, or a simple ticketing system.

Hopefully it will have an API that can be used to tie back to a given event or class of events..
