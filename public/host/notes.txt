This is going to be one of the more complex page sets.

Overall we are going to show a lot of details as well as many different options
related to the given host.

Breakdown of Components, as well as Monitor changes or status will be done here.

This has to look good dammit!  


Use the templates that you have been writing.  Keep support for adhoc ones
as well.  If a user adds a template in there, lets leverage it shall we?

How will we know if we need a display template?  Lets go off of our monitors
since those are likely going to be the oddballs that can have additonal info.

All builtin stuff will be available IF stuff exists to pull for them.

Use cheap and fast API calls to see what we have available, and THEN begin
the more expensive queries for data at that point.
