Primary files:

index.php
Initial landing page..
defines basic global layout
Controls basic security.
If nothing is defined use main.html (catchall)


++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Child files:

deviceDetails:
Pull in the main information and use as one big array.  Seems smarter than having discrete arrays.
Define the basic UI, however all of the main display parts are defined in displayComponents so we can make
modular parts of the dispaly.  What I use others may hate.

hostPropertiesEdit:
define specific details for the host.  Vars can be used for monitoring or custom "things"
defines if SNMP is available for monitoring.
Discovery builds the initial values from a global template in the database

modifyDevice:
Change FQDN, IP address, and if it can be monitored.
Add device to specific monitoring "groups"

deviceDelete:
Just what it says on the label.  Kill something in fire...

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Subdirectories:

functions:
any special functions that deal specifcally with hosts..  Making OS image links, etc.

includes:
This is any custom headers or footers that change from the defaults that the main site usees.

displayComponents:
Make the deviceDetails look decent.  Define the different parts so they can be removed if a user
does not want them.  Also make sure they display nothing if there is no information.
