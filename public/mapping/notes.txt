It is annoying, however we cannot easily call 127.0.0.1 or localhost for the API calls.

this is due to CORS set on the browser.  Using the public IP, or the hostname works.  However this is sub-optimal.

Going to have to address this issue or make a better solution for the destination.  Perhaps use an incllude, with the API hostname and ports
defined and then consumed internally on the web page itself.  This could work for all pages, and have a common destination value.


config/api.php contains vars to use with an include:
apiHostname
apiUrl
apiPort

Future: (currently unused for api calls)
apiUser
apiPass


The mapping directory is likely going to simply be a bunch of small scripts that will do one small thing, and be broken into
different categories.

IE
 Add new host, change existing host, nuke host
 Add new monitor, change existing monitor, disable monitor

I am waffling on the idea of a single page to do each of these groups of actions..  Perhaps a main page with subpages for the acutal work..
