Mapping notes, and details.

MONITORS:
  CREATE:
    Initial creation of monitors does NOT add hosts at creation time
    Iteration cycle outside of existing values require a restart of the poller
      * different iteration cycles are distinct daemons
    Graphite is not usable when there is not an existing template file for SNMP
      * Manual testing and validation scripts exist in templates/directory in API
    databaseMetric is saved as JSON in the database
    NRPE, SHELL currently internally attempt to parse performance metrics from return data
      * if parsing suceeds, that is sent to graphite by default currently
    check args: supports the following args:
      * $hostname
      * $ipAddress
      * defined database hostAttributes as an array based on hostname + checkName (future)

    SNMP: 
    check name
    check args
    type: walk, get
    Storage: database only
        * databaseMetric should be tested before using on adhoc metric sizes being added to database
        * graphite can be selected ONLY when a template exists that will parse the results
    iteration: 300

    NRPE:
    check name
    check args
    type: nrpe
    storage: database, graphite (internal attempts parsing to graphite)
    iteration: 300

    SHELL:
    check name
    check args
    type: shell
    storage: database, graphite (internal attempts parsing to graphite)
    iteration: 300

    CURL:
    check name
    check args
    type: curl
    storage: database
    iteration: 300

    FUTURE:
    check name
    check args
    type: TBD
    storage: database
    iteration: 300
  
  UPDATE:
    Set hostnames to be monitored by created poller
    Alter existing values for given monitors

  DELETE:
    Remove hosts from monitor
    Remove single host from monitor
    Remove entire monitor
