<b>Use:</b>
  These pages are all specific to monitoring itself.  This is where you define your monitors at.
  While there are several bulit in monitors already created, they may not do exactly what you
  want.  This is the area that you define exactly what you need for your monitoring.  Overall
  This is intended to take simple and fast monitors and run them on a given iteration cycle.
  Fast pollers are possible, but not really recommended as per-minute, or even sub-minute
  monitoring is not the intention of this tool.  When you start getting that granular in general
  you are looking more at performance than failure modes, and loose the focus of what this tool
  is intended to give you.  The fastest recommended iteration cycle is one minute, and should be
  used with FAST simple checks.  Commonly "alive" or ping checks.  Going complex here will not
  increase your ability to react to events and will actually hamper you with a bunch of false
  alarms.  You will get "noise" no matter what system you use, and you are going to have to
  keep this in mind when defining what you care about, and how often you check it.

<b>MONITORS:</b>
<b>  New Monitor:</b>
    Initial creation of monitors does NOT add hosts at creation time
    Iteration cycle outside of existing values require a restart of the poller
      * different iteration cycles are distinct daemons
    Graphite is not usable when there is not an existing template file for SNMP
      * Manual testing and validation scripts exist in templates/ directory on the API server
    databaseMetric is saved as JSON in the database
    NRPE, SHELL currently internally attempt to parse performance metrics from return data
      * if parsing suceeds, that is sent to the graphing engine by default
    check args: supports the following args:
      * $hostname
      * $ipAddress
      * defined database hostAttributes as an array based on hostname + checkName (future)

<b>    SNMP:</b>
    check name
    check args
    type: walk, get
    Storage: database only
        * databaseMetric should be tested before using on adhoc metric sizes being added to database
        * graphite can be selected ONLY when a template exists that will parse the results
        * SNMP details are pulled from the hostAttributes array from previous discovery runs on the host
    iteration: 300

<b>    NRPE:</b>
    check name
    check args
    type: nrpe
    storage: database, rrd, graphite (internal attempts parsing to graphite)
    iteration: 300

<b>    SHELL:</b>
    check name
    check args
    type: shell
    storage: database, rrd, graphite (internal attempts parsing to graphite)
    iteration: 300

<b> (vaporware currently)   CURL:</b>
    check name
    check args
    type: curl
    storage: database
    iteration: 300

<b>    FUTURE:</b>
    check name
    check args
    type: You tell me
    storage: database
    iteration: 300
  
<b>  Search Monitor:</b>
    Set hostnames to be monitored by created poller
    Alter existing values for given monitors
    Ability to disable a specific monitor simply by changing the type to disabled
    Remove or delete a given monitor

<b>  Alter an Event Mapping for a Monitor:</b>
    See which mapping matches your monitor, and change the default values
    or other event attributes associated with the event when the monitor
    sets that event.
