Hosts are defined by physical or logical types, not by OS running on them.

OS information is a host attribute

Anything with an IP can be a host.

Virtual hosts are going to need to be studied with care, as they are really a
true host with an alternate name.  Service checks will have to be aware of what
they are checking when dealing with virtual hosts.

Some things will check IP, others will check by FQDN.  both must be supported to make
this work the way it should.

Service checks will need to be able to either already HAVE the IP adddress, or a query
will have to be made.  Think it is a better idea to have the IP already on hand if we can
do some kind of join on hosts >> IP.  This can be done on specific host checks, however we run
into trouble with the hostgroups.  Since that is a named list, we are still going to have to pull
hostnames when we get a hostGroup.  We should grab the IP at that time.


Hosts defined for infrastructure can only exist in a single path.  Virtual hosts, while it may be pretty
to define as something else, are not real things, so we are not going to pretend they are.  Service checks
against a host will be able to run against VHOSTS that are defined.  

KVM and other virtualization guests ARE real, and are treated as discrete entities.
