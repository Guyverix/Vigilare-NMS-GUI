<b>Use:</b>

The Access Levels defined for use when using the built in database (V1) are set as a string currently.
They are defined as "user,tech,operator,admin".  These are all well and good, however they do not have
a concept of this level and below.  As of 05-25-2024 the transition to integer values AND these values
will happen.  This will allow for granular access levels with the ability to set very specific ones
as well.

The integer levels will begin at zero and go to 100.  While I am sure some smartass will dial it up to 1000
for some strange reason, the expectation will be as stated.

While the wiki contains some of the reasons or logic they dont have hard set values.
This is an attempt to flesh out some basics.

0    Lowest level of access that can be achieved. (user)
     Likely something like a Kiosk mode

25   Manager or Director access. (tech)
     This is not a slight against managers.  This is to define
     that they are likely not going to care as much about blood and guts
     as they are about getting data from the system to manage teams.
     In general stuff like reporting that you may not want to be available
     in a Kiosk mode, or application level status work.

50   Think day to day operations (operator)
     Full access to the event system including the ability to transform
     via the replay system events that happen.  They however will have minimal
     access into things such as admin functions when working with users.

100  Full access with no restrictions to any API calls. (admin)
     Just what it says on the label.  No restrictions

The logic on the API side is simple.  Your number must be >= what the access level
is to get data from the API call.

HOWEVER, there will be times that a user will have to have access to something that
they normally would not.  This goes back to the string option.  If you dont have the
access level needed BUT you do have a string match for an option, this will allow access
to the API.

This can be a security issue, so the bypass should be configured only while the additional access
is needed, and then removed after the work is completed.
