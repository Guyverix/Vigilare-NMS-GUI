<b>Use:</b>
  Creation and modification of a maintenance type event.  This is used for temporary suppression of events that fire within a given time-band.
  It is critical to note, that full outages can be suppressed when using this.  There is preliminary support for Maintenance events that are not
  expected to be service impacting and can event when something like that happens, but this is mainly stubbed at this time.  Version 1 will mainly
  be givning support to the suppression of events for a given timeframe and then remove the suppression after that point.

  Internally housekeeping will age out events even when they are suppressed just like normal.  It will continue to work against all
  events that occur, and set or clear events based on notification or timer expires.  At the end of a maintenance event all outstanding events
  will show up within the Event Console with all counters intact.

  It is important to remember that these events were suppressed unless specifically looked for in the console or at a host level.

<b>Create:</b>
  Creating a maintenenace event will cover hosts, or host groups that are given for the event.  Each event has a start and end time.
  The hosts associated with the event will not event in the main console until event completion.  The ability to see the events and see only
  maintenance related events can be done via a secondary Matintenance Event Page.

<b>Update:</b>
  Updating an event is only possible if the event has not completed yet.  There is not much point in editing something that already happened.

<b>Delete:</b>
  Deleting an event is normally only possible against events in the future.  If an event was cancelled but not removed, it will remain in the database
  forever unless an Admin goes to remove it from the database with additional privileges.
