<b>Use:</b>
  The daemon control pages are under the administration link.  In general
  you need a higher level of access to mess with these controls.  You can kill
  off all of your monitoring if you start goofing with the controls or alter iteration
  cycles in strange ways.  Current version supports stop/start/restart/status directly
  against the API server Pollers.  This does not take into account remote Pollers nor
  is there are current way to control them yet.  In version 2 the plan is to have something
  like housekeeping or a logical hub restart remote services when told to do so.
  However, right now the system has no need for this ability yet.
