infrastructure page
<pre>


The infrastructure link is simply a list of hosts broken out into BASIC types.

This allows for hostGroups to exist so we can bundle hosts together in a reproducible way.

The intent is not for VHOST's to be defined here, although it is possible to do so.

Overall the intent is a visual representation of what we have in place.

Being able to hang service checks from this is a nice bonus.

That being said we must use caution, as there are always damn snowflakes that

do not fit.

Oddballs that fall into a category BUT do not fit the monitoring spec, are going to need some
kind of ignore flag for the hostGroup setting.  However this is going to be fragile I suspect.

Additional thought is going to have to be put into this.


The Alive designation is a possible landing point for hosts that cannot be monitored via some kind
of template, or for things I was trying to avoid such as VHOSTs.

This will allow an area to exist that will be outside of the blanket template system.  Hosts in here
must have their monitors defined on a per-host basis.  That will be the only way to reasonably do any
kind of heartbeat unique to the host itself.
