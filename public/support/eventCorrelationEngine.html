<b>Use:</b>
  The "Event Correlation Engine" (ECE) is an alarm aggregation of lower level events based on predefined
  rules.  Every run is run against the main event table, with the result showing the state at a higher level
  for use by managers, or even public display.  Try to think of it as a simplification to give a more concice
  summary of what is going on without too much detail to muddy the waters.

  The location for the ECE is under the Admin panel.  Currently the database is defined, but no pages or
  logic leverages this yet.

  The ECE is going to end up being a compex beast, which will leverage multiple
  API calls to render its display.  Additionally once the number of rules gets high enough, I expect to
  see a service decline overall since it has to run all rules at once.  In the future, I will likely
  end up filtering this down to specific services on demand.  However note that if a dashboard is in the
  mix for public use, this will imply that everything is shown.  So this will run the full ruleset currently.

<b>Logic:</b>
  We can have N+1 events active, but until they match rules that are defined higher levels of display will not
  reflect the issues.  For example, the public does not need to see on a dashboard if a hard drive is full.

  This being the case, the initial values defined within the event specifically: application, customerVisible, osEvent
  come into play much more.  These three values specficially are the first canary used to see if we need to change states
  of the higher level monitoring.  Additionally, we can also create rules that will take events that are not flagged with
  true on these alarms and if too many exist active at a given time will trigger warnings at a higher level even if overall
  the events themselves are on their own not showing a service impact.

  Servce A, has Application B and Application C associated with it.  If Application C gets 20 non-customer affecting events
  active at once, it will still trigger a warning event in the ECE due to the fact that something serious is happening, but
  not specifically service impacting from the monitoring perspective.

<b>Current Table definitions:</b>
  Currently the ECE database table contains different definitions to work with
  * id (integer)
    * This is the rule number globally, not the order it is run in
  * active (string)
    * true or false (is the rule "active")
  * appName (string)
    * Generic name for the applications grouped together IE webservers
  * appRuleOrder (integer)
    * define the order you wish the rules to run in.
  * serviceName (string)
    * This is the name of the service being provided.  Later I may flip this and Application
    * This is the name that your customers know for the service being provided
  * raw (string)
    * true or false (is the appCorrelation raw SQL or a template)
  * appCorrleation (text)
    * either JSON array of standardized values or raw SQL command
  * eceSummary (text)
    * PHP code to set values for display and override defaults
    * This is beginnings of logic to increment and leverage earlier rule results and compound and evealuate them.

<b>Scale:</b>
  The way the ECE intended to scale, is that a company, or org will have N+1 services that they offer users or customers.
  To make the service, you have N+1 Applications doing the work.  Each specific application can have N+1 servers or hosts
  where the compute is done.

  Once the initial up-down monitoring is in place and active, this is the point where an operator begins to look at performance
  and decide on the level of degrade they can handle before having the ECE start changing states at a higher level.  One
  company may allow for 10 servers to be down in a fleet of 20, but another may consider that an event type that should
  bubble up and become visible on a customer facing dashboard.  This should all be dependent on what the SLA is defined as
  for a given company.  Additionally, this will allow for different kinds of reporting to happen for proof of meeting or
  missing a given SLA.

<b>Rules:</b>
  The current rules are defined in the Event Correlation Engine table.  By design every rule is run on a cycle
  and "hits" will cause an event of some kind to be displayed at a higher level.  The event display will commonly
  be one of two types, either a summary green/yellow/red stoplight style, or look identical to the normal "Event Engine"
  output and display a summary in the same way as unfiltered events.

  Rule definitions are based on arrays of matches.  This is a positive match based system.  IE, if you do not match
  a rule, then no event can occur.

  Rules are run in order, this way we will always have consistent results.  It will also make it easier to create
  a different type of event if we always run the exact same way.

  Rules can only escalate up, never down.  We assume a good state, and at any point that we are not, we change
  state in the ECE and count the hit as a discrete value.  Each hit will set its own event summary for what it was
  looking for when it triggered.

  appCorrelation template JSON values:
    * { "table": "event", "column": "device", "search": "equal", "value": "guyver-myth.iwillfearnoevil.com", "link": "and" , "table2": "history", "column2": "endTime", "search2": "greaterEqual", "value2": "INTERVAL -1 day"}
    * { "table": "event", "column": "application", "search": "equal", "value": "true", "link": "none" }
    * Currently only supports one link of "and" or "or" as SQL clauses in the template.  More complex results
      will require using raw SQL queries.

  Simple rules are as follows:
    * Application A: 0 hostGroup['foo'] if > 30 Major alarms for any hosts in this group no matter the
                     reason, raise a Yellow warning
    * Application B: 0 Any alarms with a application = true at Major or below raise a yellow warning
    * Application B: 1 Any alarms with customerVisible = true at Major or below raise a Red warning which
                     will override rule 0 and add a second active event (We have 2 events, and overall Red health)

  Complex rule examples:
    * Sorry, but have not tried to make really ugly rules yet, as I much prefer the KISS principle and am less
      inclined to make one rule I cannot read compared to 5 (or even 10) simple ones I can understand.
