Replay Event notes, and details.
<br>
<pre>
Use:
  Alteration of a given event either active or from history.  This allows
  for future events to behave in the "mapped" fashion and be reproducible.
  This is also the area where you map any "unmapped" or "unknown" type of events
  into the database and set the initial values for them.

Location:
  Main >> Events >> Replay Event
  Choose the event that happend in the past, and click the heart-break icon on the far right.

Display:
  The far left shows exactly what was saved into the database.  The right side table is your
  basic manipulation area.  Testing the mapping does not save changes into the database, but validates
  your PHP syntax.  This does not guarentee that your changes will work, just that they are syntatically
  correct.

Display "Parsed Values and Changes":
  Every variable that is in use for the given event has the ability to be modified by the Event pre-processing.
  Do keep in mind that the simpler the processing the better.  Doing big complex definitions will work but
  will be less maintainable by end users when something changes in the future.

  It is worth noting that some caution must be used for the received OID or default name, as well as the
  alarm name itself.
  If a raw OID was received, leave it.  This is your unique value for future events.  You should however
  get on the public internet and see what the manufacturer says that alarm means, and use that to create
  your alarm name.

  The alarm names must be unique in the database.  It is encouraged to use camelCase
  for your alarm names when possible (just so some kind of standard is set).

  Never use the keyword "unmapped" for your alarm name.  This has special meaning for events.  I would
  even discourage having that string in an alarm name in general. "app-unmapped" and "unmappedApp"
  could bite you in the future, so just dont.

  Note: In some cases, arrays as strings are making it into things like summary from NRPE checks
        however this is inconsistent.  Always validate what the event came in like when
        working on a pre-processing transformation of your event.

        At this time Post-Processing is only stubbed.  It does nothing, as I have not really
        found a good use case for it (yet/ever).

  The supported variables that are in place currently are:
  $evid            (string)       event ID.  Never change this
  $known_hostname  (string)       generally the FQDN from table Device.hostname
  $receive_time    (string)       date stamp in UTC
  $event_age_out   (int)          timer in seconds to allow event to remain active.
  $counter         (int)          counts times the event has fired off without clearing
  $receiver        (string)       Usually the IP address of the trap or API receiver
  $event_severity  (int)          Number from 0 (clear) to 5 (critical)
  $event_ip        (string)       generally the IP address from table Device.address
  $event_source    (string)       The IP address that sent the event.  This can be different than the host in alarm
  $event_name      (string)       A unique name for the alarm
  $event_type      (int)          Not completely active.  Integer value for snmptrap, local check, remote checks (default 3)
  $monitor         (int)          Not completely active.  Integer defining if this should be monitored or not
  $event_summary   (string)       A summary of an event for the UI to display
  $details         (array)        A usually parsable array of raw data that consists of everything that was sent with the event
  $details_array   (array)        If $details is not a valid array, this has attempted to convert it into one.

  Example Uses:
    Set a pretty summary:
      $event_summary = "Event " . $event_name . " was recieved from " . $known_hostname;

    Set an override severity other than default when something matches:
      if ( $known_hostname == "fake.host.com" ) {
        $event_severity = 5;
      }

    Change severity if we have a high count of events:
      if ($counter >= 10) {
        $event_severity = 5;
      }

    More complex change example: 
    Note: This specific event type has array["string oid value"] defined inside it
          All traps are different, and will have different array types

    In this example, we are exploding the array $details and looking at
    each line for a string match.
      foreach ($details as $loc) {
        if ( false !== strpos($loc, "1.3.6.1.4.1.24591.1.1.3") ) {
          $rawName = explode("24591.1.1.3", $loc);
          $event_name = trim($rawName[1]);
        }
      }
      if ( empty($event_name)) {
        $event_name = "blahEventName";
      }

After successful tests:
  Simply save the mapping with the "Change Mapping Now" button.  All future
  events that match the incomming OID or eventName will follow your pre-processing
  logic and alter the event the way you are expecting.
