<b>Use:</b>
  The Administration pages are where more sensitive controls are placed.  This is also
  where it will be more likely to get 403 responses when you attempt to do things which require API calls.
  Additionally, this is where tasks such as creating a maintenence event timer is defined.  While this
  may not be the best location currently, and may move in the future the fact that you can suppress
  events with this shows that this is something that is dangerous and can have a customer visible
  impact if done incorrectly.

<b>User Controls:</b>
  Here is where an administrator can create new users, or change a current users access levels.  Additionally
  you can lock accounts and do password resets for a user.  Currently a user cannot give a different user
  more access than they themselves have.  For example a Chief Petty Officer cannot promote a Seaman Recruit
  above the rank Chief Petty Officer.

  In this use case a technician can alter a read only or even kiosk user level up to a technician level
  but no higher.  If additional access is required, then a user with that higher level of access must
  grant it.  Managers and supervisors must have the ability to limit who has access to what, and this seems
  the most reasonable limit to place when working in a fault management environment.

<b>Discovery Actions:</b>
  There is still a lot of magic hand-waving on this one.  In a general sense, this functionality is more of
  a subnet autodiscovery.  Admins need a good way to find hosts in a network.  Additionally, being able to
  generate a report of unmonitored, or under monitored hosts can only be to the benifit of the org itself.

<b>Daemon Controls:</b>
  This is where you can stop/start/restart/status a running set of daemons against the API server itself.
  This is not currently smart enough to restart remote poller daemons with the V1 release.  In the future
  it does make sense to be able to do so (if possible) from this single point.  However if a daemon dies
  it is commonly due to severe issues that need addressed in the code, so a remote restart may not take care
  of the problem.  At that point it will require direct human intervention on the remote poller host in
  question to fix the issue.

<b>Maintenance Controls:</b>
  This is also still at the magic hand-waving stage.  Being able to set a maintenance event is simple enough
  but what does this mean?  In a generic sense it will be an event suppression system tied to the 
  "Event Correlation Engine (ECE)" so that while a maintenance event is ongoing alarms firing will not
  confuse technicians, and they can more easily validate events that remain after completion of a
  maintenance event.
  The plan at this point is to support create/modify/delete events that have not happened.  Historical
  events will not be able to be removed as they are a record of what has happened in the past.  Additional
  notes, and event RCA's should be able to be created from what a maintenance event is going to cover.
