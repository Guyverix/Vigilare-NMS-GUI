Sigh, yes this was from chatGPT, but I kinda like how simple it is..

HTML (put in your <head>)
<!-- Default theme (dark) -->
<link id="theme-css" rel="stylesheet" href="/css/dark/vigilare-dashboard.css">

HTML (somewhere in your navbar/header)
<button id="themeToggle" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary">
  Switch Theme
</button>

One script that swaps /css/vigilare-dashboard.css â†” /css/vigilare-dashboard-light.css and remembers the choice with localStorage.




JS (after Bootstrap JS bundle)
JS already in this directory... Call it.. :)
